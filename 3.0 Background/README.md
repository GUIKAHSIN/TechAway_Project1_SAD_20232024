KADA currently relies on a Document Management System (DMS) that has been in use for the past 15 years. This system requires filling out physical forms to record data. Users must complete a form to apply for membership or a loan and then submit it for processing.

Figure 3.1 is a KADA member registration form. KADA current membership registration process relies on a paper form that applicants must fill out and submit. The process requires individuals to provide personal, employment and family information and agree to various fees and contributions. However, this manual system takes a long time, it also prone to data entry errors, and requires a lot of physical storage space. In addition, it limits the accessibility of potential members who cannot easily obtain or submit the form in person.

Figure 3.2 show KADA loan application form. A good loan application process should be user-friendly, efficient, accurate, secure, accessible online, and transparent. But KADA current manual process is time-consuming, error-prone and requires physical storage. Digital systems will simplify the applications, improve efficiency, reduce errors, improve accessibility, and secure data by storing it in a data store.

Figure 3.3 is a KADA member financial statements. As we can see, the current process for generating and distributing member financial statements at KADA involves manually collecting financial data from various records and compiling it into individual statements. These statements include details such as the member's name, identity card number, shares held, loans taken, and savings. This manual system is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient, leading to delays and inaccuracies in financial reporting. By digitizing the process of generating and distributing member financial statements at KADA, it can streamline operations, reduce errors, and improve efficiency. Automation will save time, ensure accuracy, and allow for easier access to up-to-date member information By looking at the existing system above, we can clearly see that due to manual handling, data transfer and verification take a significant amount of time. So Mr. Ahmad Rohailan aims to enhance the current system by transitioning to an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS), which incorporates electronic elements to manage documents, including the use of spreadsheets and electronic data extraction.

Moreover, the KADA system lacks a comprehensive reporting system. Mr. Ahmad Rohailan has identified this as a major issue. A well-developed reporting system is crucial for decision-making. Currently, KADA faces a shortage of data resources, which hampers its ability to make quick decisions. In today's fast-paced environment, speed is critical for efficiency, as it can secure more opportunities and resources for the organization.

Additionally, members cannot access their account details anytime, anywhere, due to the absence of an online channel. Members must visit the department in person to inquire about their account details or dividend amounts. This increases the workload for agency staff, who must retrieve and convey the account information, leading to long waits and member dissatisfaction.

To address these challenges, KADA intends to upgrade to an EDMS for user registration and the user loan application process. The primary goal of this upgrade is to digitize the document filling process, enhance work efficiency, and strengthen document security. By adopting this innovative and high-tech system, KADA aims to provide a seamless user experience and make informed, timely decisions, ultimately achieving significant organizational improvements.
